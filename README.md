# Unit-10-A-Yen-for-the-Future
 The financial departments of large companies are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies.
- I will test the Time Series Forecasting and Linear Regression Modeling tools in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

## Libraries Needed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Pathlib
- motplotlib

## New Libraries:
- From the "sklearn.linear_model" library, we will be importing "LinearRegression" and "mean_squared_error".
- Import the "statsmodels.api" as sm.
- From the "statsmodels.tsa.arima_model" library, we will be importing "ARMA" and "ARIMA".
- From the "arch" library, we will be importing "arch_model".

## Tips: 
- Remember to restart kernel incase of "bugs".
